In data science problems, it’s common for data sets to have far more dimensions.\r\n",

        "The 2D world is flat like a piece of paper or a computer screen. In the language of math, a flat, 2D space is referred to as a plane. An object living in a 2D plane has the two dimensions of height and width but no third dimension of depth. Likewise, you can describe locations in 2D by two pieces of information: their vertical and horizontal positions. To describe the location of points in the plane, you need a reference point. We call that special reference point the origin.\r\n",
