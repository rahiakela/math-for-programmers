An arrow from the origin covers some measurable displacement in the horizontal and vertical directions, and these values uniquely specify the vector. Instead of using two rulers, we could just as well use a ruler and a protractor. Starting with the vector (4, 3), we can measure or calculate its length to be 5 units, and then use our protractor to identify the direction.\r\n",
